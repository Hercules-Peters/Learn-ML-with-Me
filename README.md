# Learn-ML-with-Me
Welcome to **ML-Journey**, my personal progress tracker for mastering machine learning! This repository showcases my projects, notebooks, and explorations as I advance my skills, starting with hands-on projects like the Titanic dataset.

## 📂 Project Overview
### 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction
The first project in this journey involves analyzing the famous Titanic dataset. This project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more)
- Insights and visualization

The notebook used for this project is [`Titanic_data.ipynb`](./Titanic_data.ipynb).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 What's Next?
As I progress, I’ll be adding more projects, including:
- Image classification 🖼️
- Natural language processing 📝
- Time series forecasting ⏳
- Advanced deep learning models 🤖

## 🤝 Contributing
This is a personal learning repo, but feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or discuss approaches.
